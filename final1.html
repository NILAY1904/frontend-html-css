        Acknowledged as the wettest place in the world, the mesmerizing village of Mawsynram,
        located 61 kms south of Shillong is a nature lover's delight and the perfect destination 
        for a weekend trip. Mawsynram trounces Cherrapunjee by a slight margin in being the wettest place in India.
        The 'Maw' in Mawsynram is a Khasi word meaning 'stone'.
        It symbolizes the unique megaliths unearthed in the Khasi Hill area. 
        The village is well known for its huge formation of a stalagmite, which takes after the shape of a 'Shivling'. 
        Located in the East Khasi Hill district of Meghalaya, Mawsynram is 1400 m above sea level. 
        The rains are so powerful in Mawsynram that the local villagers have to make use of
        thick grass to sound-proof their homes from the thunderous rain.

        Named after David Scott, a British officer, the David Scott Trail is an old 
        and one of the most popular trekking routes in Meghalaya. It is a 16 kilometres long trek
        which stretches from Mawphlang to Lad Mawphlang, both villages known for their history,
        culture and folklore. A centerstage of Khasi culture, Mawphlang is one of the settlements 
        in the Khasi hills named after monoliths and having sacred groves. The trail was laid down 
        to connect Assam and Bangladesh during the 19th century. The trek can be done from either side,
        but it is commonly attempted from the Mawphlang side since it makes it a less ascending trail.

        The trail is not well marked and one can take the help of locals for directions. 
        David Scott Trekking trails is a storehouse of wonderful landscapes that one experiences 
        as they go through. Rivers, woods, massive rock formations, cascading waters, 
        streams gushing down from mountains, expansive meadows, forest groves and bridges connecting villages
        the trek has it all. It is a beautiful day hike and one can begin the trek 
        from any point in the quaint Mawphlang village, go through the winding route across the hills and valleys,
        rest at the popular resting spot called Ka Kor Ka Shonmai, admire the tomb of Camilla, 
        click photographs of the hanging bridge over the River Umain and stop by the few Khasi villages 
        enroute to hear from their folk tales. Seasoned trekkers never miss out on this old trail, when in Meghalaya.

        At the height of 6449 ft or 1965 m above sea level, Shillong Peak is the highest point of Shillong.
        It offers a breathtaking panoramic view of the entire city, the Himalayas, its waterfalls as well as
        of the Bangladesh plains. A telescope is available for tourists to get a bird's eye view.
        Trekking up to this semi-circular Shillong Peak is highly recommended for the best views 
        but it is often bounded by heavy fog.

        It is said that Shillong gets its name from the Shillong Peak itself. Regional tales tell that the patron deity
        'Leishyllong' resides in the hills and protects the city from all evils. The U Shulong site at the top of the peak
        is sacred and every spring, a ritual is organised there. The Shillong Peak is situated at the air force base 
        and features a radar station of the Indian Air Force. Due to security reasons, heavy checking is done at the gates,
        and tourists are asked to deposit their cameras.

        Named after an Elephant like stone at its foot, the Elephant Falls are amongst the most popular falls in the North-East, 
        situated next to Shillong. It is a tourists' paradise with three layers of the falls accessible to the 
        layman from different vantage points. The Britishers named this fall so owing to the presence of an elephant-shaped rock
        on one side of the fall. However, the stone disintegrated and was washed away due to an earthquake in 1897. 
        Elephant Waterfalls is a superb place for spending some time in the midst of nature while capturing the incredible moments for your keepsake.

        The breathtaking Elephant falls were referred to as 'Ka Kshaid Lai Pateng Khohsiew' by the local Khasi people, 
        which means 'The Three Step Waterfalls', as these falls consist of three mesmerising falls in succession. 
        The first of the three waterfalls are tucked between the dense trees and are very broad. The second waterfall reduces to 
        thin strands of water and is almost negligible in winters due to the receding water levels. 
        The third and the most visible waterfall is the tallest with clear water flowing like a sheet of milk on the dark rocks in the backdrop. 
        Out of the three, the third waterfall tends to strike the visitors as the most impressive. Elephant Falls is a great stopover 
        destination before one head for further journeys into Meghalaya. Located 12 km away from the capital city of Shillong,
        it is one of the most visited falls in the beautiful state.
